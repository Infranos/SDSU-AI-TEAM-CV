HI!  Welcome to the 2018 AI Club CV workshop.

In here, you'll find:
-dino_runner.py
	Our main program

-custom_ocr.py
	For our demo

-motion_detector.py
	The code we have to edit.
	Tracks approaching obstacles

-steps_taken.txt
	Just a quick overview of our methodology/reasoning
	
	
For this particular exercise, it should be noted that I have not scaled grabbed images to be independent of one's screen resolution.  This time, you'll have to edit the numerical values for screen-saving by hand; but fret not, for I shall have it corrected for round 2.  Stay tuned for our neural network workshop!
