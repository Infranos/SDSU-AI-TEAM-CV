HI!  Welcome to the 2018 AI Team CV workshop.
This code runs Google's Dinosaur game, tracks the score, and looks ahead to dodge incoming objects.
The purpose of this code is to help teach the basics of computer vision, and is not yet supposed to play the game fully.

In here, you'll find:
-dino_runner.py
	Our main program

-custom_ocr.py
	For our demo; tracks the score

-motion_detector.py
	The code we have to edit.
	Tracks approaching obstacles
	
-motion_detector_complete.py
	Cheatsheet for the above.
	So we know what the goal looks like

-steps_taken.txt
	Just a quick overview of our methodology/reasoning
	
	
Stay tuned for our neural network workshop!
